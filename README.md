> _There are some pretty big features coming (most notably displaying the contents of **vim.lsp.buf.hover()**). This branch contains all of them. The full development of this plugin has been temporarily suspended due to my ongoing University exams, scheduled to conclude around early March. Until then, I will only be handling important issues. Thank you for your patience!_
### TODO
- [x] Optimization (skip when mouse is not over any code)
- [x] Limit window size when the height exceeds half of the screen's height
- [x] Fix the title sometimes being smaller than the contents of the window
- [x] Display the exact contents of vim.lsp.buf.hover()
- [ ] Display "LSP Info" in the whole window
- [ ] Fix vim.lsp.util.stylize_markdown needing non-readonly and modifiable buffer
